# Introduction 
The purpose of this repository is to showcase how you can setup the process of storing Sitecore CDP + Personalize templates, connections and other development resources in Source control for a proper development life cycle with the CDP/Personalize products.

This process would likely not be right for all customers, but large organizations that want more control and testing of what's in their UAT or Production tenants might opt for this path.
